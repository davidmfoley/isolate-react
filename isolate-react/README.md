## Test-drive react components and hooks

`isolate-react` is the missing tool for test-driving your react components.

It's focused on speed and simplicity, has zero dependencies, doesn't require a DOM emulator, and supports any test runner.

### Flexible support for whatever level of testing you prefer:
- [x] Test react hooks
- [x] Render a single component at a time (isolated/unit testing) 
- [x] Render multiple components toegether (integrated testing)

### Low -friction:
- [x] No virtual DOM or other tools to install
- [x] Works with any test runner that runs in node (jest, mocha, tape, tap, etc.)
- [x] Full hook support
- [x] Easy access to set context values for testing
- [x] Very fast

### Render react components in isolation
- [x] functional components that use hooks
- [x] class components
