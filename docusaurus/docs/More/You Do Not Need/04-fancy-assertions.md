title: You don't need an assertion library
---

We've grown accustomed to fancy assertions. But do they provide value? 

These are the assertions that I regularly use in my day-to-day coding life:

- assert that an object has a specific value
- assert that an object has a specific shape
- assert that a function throws a specific error
- assert that a function rejects with a specific error
- occasionally: assert about a boolean test



`object a` is/is not the same instance as `object b`
