title: A compendium of tools that you do not need
---

As developers, we love dev tools.

They are helpful (until we try to use them for our specific problem that is *almost* the same as the intended usage).

They save us time (until a transitive dependency update breaks our application).

Every library we install has a cost and (hopefully) also provides a benefit. This is a collection of tools that have a greater cost than benefit, for most teams.
